# employee_directory_v1
This was project the 10th in a series of 12 in the TeamTreehouse Techdegree. The focus here was using a public **API** to create a randomly generated list of mock users to emullate an employee directory. The focus was primarily meant to be on javascript and API's but many skills were utilized to create this project.
